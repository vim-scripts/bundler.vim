This is a lightweight bag of Vim goodies for Bundler (http://gembundler.com), best accompanied by rake.vim (vimscript #3669) and/or rails.vim (vimscript #1567).

Features:

* :Bundle, which wraps bundle.
* An internalized version of bundle open: :Bopen (and :Bsplit, :Btabedit, etc.).
* 'path' and 'tags' are automatically altered to include all gems from your bundle.  (Generate those tags with gem-ctags (https://github.com/tpope/gem-ctags)!)
* Syntax highlighting for Gemfile and Gemfile.lock.
